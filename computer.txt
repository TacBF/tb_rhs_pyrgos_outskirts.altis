How you actually build integrated circuits

MOS transistor МОП транзистор но есть и дрругой транзистор который используют в
чипах: Fin transistor

Building trransitors on the top of the substrate. 

Turn on.
Apply voltage between gate and source. This acracts some electrons on the furface benith
oxide layer and froms a channel. Channel enables flow of electrins betwean soruce and drain
 
14:08 CMOS Manufacturing
Building CMOS chip is like printing

Advanced Metallization

Why different width for the wires. Wires closer to transistor are much smaller then
wires on the top. 
We want transitor near each other. Hence more wires.
